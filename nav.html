        <p><span style="display: block;padding-bottom: 6px;">This page includes all my important html files . I made this so i remember things at ones place.

I created this website as a place to bring together all of my HTML practice work and small projects in one easy and organized way. When I first started learning web development, I wanted to have a single page where I could keep everything I worked on — from simple HTML exercises to creative projects like my cartoon page and different assignments.</span> <br><span style="display: block;padding-bottom: 7px;" > This website became that space for me. It’s like my personal collection of everything I’ve learned, built, and practiced while exploring how websites are made.

In the navigation bar at the top, you’ll find links to all my files, including my cartoon practice page, HTML assignments, and other experiments I’ve done while learning. Each section represents something I learned or tried for the first time — whether it’s adding images, styling text, making tables, or using different layout techniques like flexbox. </span><br><span style="display: block;padding-bottom: 8px;">Through this site, I get to see my own progress and understand how my coding skills have grown with every small project I complete.

I also wanted this website to feel simple and welcoming. That’s why I focused on keeping the design clean, colorful, and easy to explore. The navigation menu helps anyone quickly find the project they want to view, and each link opens a new page showing what I built.</span><br><span style="display: block;padding-bottom: 6px;"> Whether it’s an HTML assignment or a small creative experiment, everything here has been made with the purpose of learning and improving step by step.

This site isn’t just for me — it’s also for anyone who’s beginning their HTML journey. I remember how confusing it felt when I started learning coding, so I wanted to share my work in a way that might inspire or help others. If someone is new to web development, they can open my pages, see the code examples, and understand how small ideas can turn into working web pages.</span><br><span style="display: block;padding-bottom: 10px;"> Each project shows that even basic tags and styles can be combined to make something interesting.

Building this website has taught me how powerful HTML and CSS can be, even in their simplest forms. From linking pages in the navbar to adding text, images, and videos, every part of this website shows what I’ve learned through practice. I’m proud of how it’s growing and how each project adds something new to it. I’ll keep updating it as I learn more about web design and development. This is just the beginning — a simple website that tells the story of my learning journey and creativity through every page, line of code, and idea I’ve built.</span>
