   <span style="color: rgb(239, 173, 6);"> Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most revolutionary technologies of the modern era. It refers to the ability of machines or computer systems to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. AI works through algorithms and large amounts of data that help machines recognize patterns, make predictions, and improve performance over time. There are different types of AI, including narrow AI, which focuses on specific tasks like voice assistants or image recognition, and general AI, which aims to think and reason like a human.</span><br><br> <span style="color: midnightblue;"> AI is widely used in daily life — from virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to recommendation systems on Netflix and YouTube. It also plays a crucial role in industries like healthcare, education, transportation, and finance. For example, AI helps doctors detect diseases early, enables self-driving cars, and enhances cybersecurity. While AI offers many benefits such as efficiency and innovation, it also raises ethical concerns about privacy, job loss, and decision transparency. Therefore, developing AI responsibly is essential to ensure it serves humanity positively and builds a better future for everyone.</span>
